## What Does PRAG-DRISHTI Mean?

**PRAG-DRISHTI** (Sanskrit: प्राग्दृष्टि)

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **प्राग्** (Prāg) | Forward / Before / Ahead |
| **दृष्टि** (Dṛṣṭi) | Vision / Sight / Perception |
| **Together** | *Foresight — the ability to see what comes next* |

> *"See where fraud money will go — before it gets there."*

## Simulation Mode & Synthetic Data Notice
This application is a functional cybercrime intelligence workstation built for the **Smart India Hackathon (Problem Statement SIH26184)**. It operates strictly on **synthetic, mathematically generated banking trails** and local machine learning models. It does not connect to live NPCI, I4C, police, or government banking networks.

---

## The Problem

Cyber-fraud investigations are often reactive. By the time a transaction trail is reconstructed, fraudulent funds may have already moved through multiple intermediary or mule accounts and been withdrawn as cash.

This creates a critical operational bottleneck:
**Fraud Reported &rarr; Investigation &rarr; Money Traced &rarr; Cash Already Withdrawn**

PRAG-DRISHTI shifts this workflow towards proactive interdiction:
**Fraud Reported &rarr; Transaction Intelligence &rarr; Prediction &rarr; Alert &rarr; Proactive Freeze**

## What is PRAG-DRISHTI?

PRAG-DRISHTI is a predictive analytics and intelligence platform designed to help Law Enforcement Agencies identify suspicious financial activity and estimate the next likely movement and cash-out location of fraudulent funds.

Instead of analysing only where the money has already moved, PRAG-DRISHTI analyses:
* Multi-hop transaction relationships (Directed Acyclic Graphs)
* Account behavioral anomaly scores
* Transaction velocity and time-of-flight
* Amount-splitting and structuring patterns
* Geospatial relationships between transactions and ATM cash-out clusters

The system converts these signals into actionable operational intelligence:
**Explainable Risk Score + Predicted Next Hop + Top Cash-Out Hotspots + Expected Time Window (20–40 min)**
